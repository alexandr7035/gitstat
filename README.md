## Technology (some notes)

- Used single activity approach and [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) (with SafeArgs) to navigate across fragments.
- Used [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
- [View binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) is used to interact with views within fragments and recyclerview adapters.
- Kotlin coroutines are used for asynchronous operations.
- [Apollo Android](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-android) ([Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) before v3.0) is used to perform [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) calls to obtain the data. Also use [OkHttp Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor) to log requests.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) database is used for cache implementation.
- Google's [FlexboxLayout](https://github.com/google/flexbox-layout) as LayoutManager and custom checkable LinearLayout are 
used to implement languages filter (see third screenshot).
- [CircleImageView](https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView) and [Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso) libs are involved to obtain and display user profile image.
- [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) library is used for plots and diagrams in the application.
- Use [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) logging in order to prevent log calls removal before every release building.
- Use [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/products/crashlytics) to catch and fix crashes.
- Use [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth) to implement Github Oauth authorization.

## Privacy Policy
- We use **Github Oauth** (Firebase) for user authentication. As soon as you click the login button, system opens the browser.  You have to enter the login and password from your **Github account**.
- As **Oauth** method is used for authentication, even if you log out, you may be able log in again without entering your Github login and password. Clear your browser cache after logging out if you wish to change GitHub account.
- We get access to ```read:user``` and ```repo``` access scopes. We **do not perform any write operations** on your github account. Full ```repo``` scope is used only to have access to your private repos data and not to perform malicious write operations.
- We do not store your account data anywhere outside the device local storage.
